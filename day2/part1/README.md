had run time error:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/rluvaton/dev/tmp/aoc2022/day2/part1/index.py", line 17, in <module>
    us_number = shapes[us]
KeyError: ' '
```

copy paste that to the chat and updated the new code

then got this:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/rluvaton/dev/tmp/aoc2022/day2/part1/index.py", line 19, in <module>
    opponent_number = shapes[opponent]
KeyError: 'Z'
```

copy pasted it and the input and the new code output 0

then reset the thread, try again failed with the same error, copy the error and paste them until got it right - around 6-8 messages
